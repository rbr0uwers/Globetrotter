Project No. 5 in CodeFactory Vienna Bootcamp

Task:
- You enjoy travelling to different places, visiting events and eating good food in restaurants. You want to create a TypeScript-based system that presents all of your experiences in a web-page.
- What is common to a place, event and restaurant is a location. Since you know about classes, you decided that your base class named Locations should hold information about city, ZIP-code, address (a single line like “Kettenbrueckengasse 23” would be enough), and a teaser image. That base class has the method display() which displays the object’s properties on the screen as HTML.
- A restaurant must also display the telephone number, type of cuisine (“Chinese”, “Indian”, “Viennese”, …)  and a web address. Restaurant objects inherit the basic properties (like ZIP-code) from the Location class. The display function must, of course, be updated.
- Same goes for Events - they have their additional properties like EventDate (“12.10.2021”) and EventTime (“17:00”) and ticket price (in EUR) that also need to be displayed in addition to the base class Locations properties.  

Challenge:
- For the regular points of this CodeReview, you need to create a structure of TypeScript/JavaScript classes, their respective constructors and their display() function that will display the relevant data of places, events and restaurants.
